In rare cases, it may lead to serious issues such as angioedema (swelling of the face, lips, or throat), high potassium levels (causing irregular heartbeat or muscle weakness), and kidney problems, signaled by reduced urine output or swelling. Severe dizziness or fainting can also occur if blood pressure drops too low. Allergic reactions, including rashes and itching, are also possible. Patients should consult their doctor if they experience any severe or unusual symptoms.",
